# Automatic-Vehicle-number-plate-system-using-edge-detection-according-to-the-color-shade-of-the-vehicle
Detect a vehicle number plate using python and it's libraries for machine learning with efficiency related to the color shade of the Vehicle.

IMPLEMENTATION

Install python opencv and other requirements from requirements.txt 

create folder anpr > and paste the .py files inside it. 

create folder "data/images" inside the anpr directory and here store the images which'll be used for processing.

inside the .py files on line 15 i.e

image_path = "{}/{}".format(images_dir, "car_17.jpg")

Instead of car_17.jpg use the file name of the car inside " ".

Process the image of Car having dark shade of color with anpr.py

Process the image of car having light shade of color with anpr2.py 

This is done for better efficiency.

Use print.py to read the license plate image and store the number in a txt file in the data directory.

If you face any problem, just email.
